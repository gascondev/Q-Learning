 # Maze Solver with Q-Learning 🧠🎯🗺️  
This project implements a reinforcement learning agent that learns to navigate a maze using the **Q-learning algorithm**. The agent explores, avoids obstacles, and finds the optimal path to reach the goal.

🚀 Features  
✅ **Q-learning** implementation for reinforcement learning.  
✅ **8x8 grid-based environment** with obstacles and goal states.  
✅ **Exploration vs. exploitation** strategy using ε-greedy.  
✅ **Visualization** of the Q-table and agent’s path.  

🛠️ Installation  
Before running the code, install the required dependencies:
